Suggestion:

Do NOT copy this file to the other language folders because it
contains nothing but people's names and hence won't need to be
translated. The names are likely to change every so often, so
unnecessary copies are good to avoid.

An exception would be for languages (if any) where commas are not used
to separate words in a list.
