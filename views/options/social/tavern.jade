                | Welcome to the Tavern! If you want to rest a while (going on vacation? sudden illness?), I'll set you up at the inn - dailies won't hurt you while you're resting. Stay a while & meet the locals.

                    span(ng-hide='user.flags.rest') Rest In The Inn
    .alert.alert-info(ng-show='user.flags.rest')
      | Whilst resting, your dailies are saved and aren't affected by day turn-over. Whether you check out tomorrow or in a week's time, you'll continue in the same state as when you checked in.
