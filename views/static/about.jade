            p.lead HabitRPG is a video game to help you improve real life habits. It "gamifies" your life by turning all your tasks (habits, dailies, and to-dos) into little monsters you have to conquor. The better you are at this, the more you progress in the game. If you slip up in life, your character starts backsliding in the game.
