      Purchasing a Re-Roll will reset all your tasks to a neutral (yellow) state, as if you'd just added them. Consider
      this an option of last resort, red tasks provide good incentive to improve. But if all that red fills you with
      despair, and the beginning of each new day proves lethal, spend the Gems and catch a reprieve!
