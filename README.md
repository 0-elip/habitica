#[HabitRPG](http://habitrpg.com/)

[HabitRPG](http://habitrpg.com/) is a habit tracker app which treats your goals like a Role Playing Game. As you accomplish goals, you level up. If you fail your goals, you lose hit points. Lose all your HP and you die.

##FAQ

###What is habit tracking?

See [7 Tools to Help Keep Track of Habits and Goals](http://www.lifehack.org/articles/technology/7-tools-to-help-keep-track-of-habits-and-goals.html) for a description and more habit tracking examples.
  
###This is confusing

If you played RPGs (Role Playing Games) growing up, this app will make perfect sense to you; otherwise, it might be overwhelming at first. Be sure to follow the tutorial when you first load the website. If it's still not your cup of tea, checkout the above link, as well as [MindBloom](https://www.mindbloom.com/).

###How do I heal?

After you play for a while you unlock the Item Store, from which you can buy health potions. Also, HP resets upon leveling up (everyone knows that!).
  
###All my tasks are red, I'm dying too fast

This is good. The worse you are at a task, the more valuable it becomes - meaning you gain more experience for completing those red tasks. This will incentivise you to try harder and to focus on the more difficult tasks. If you *really* need a bail-out, you can "Re-Roll" from the item store for $1, which resets all your tasks to a clean slate. It costs real money to prevent you from abusing it.
  
###How do I log in / save my data?

HabitRPG is built on [DerbyJS](http://derbyjs.com/), which doesn't yet support authentication. As soon as EveryAuth becomes available to Derby, I'll implement it - that and the other network integration aspects on the roadmap. You can follow the progress [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/derbyjs/7U3xvoPWd-g) and [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/derbyjs/oyz2JBwo1AQ).

In the meantime, a workaround has been built to use a private url, similar to Workflowy's shared lists, which you can use to access your account from multiple computers. Click the top-right profile button and bookmark the URL it provides.

##Roadmap
* [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pidkmpibnnnhneohdgjclfdjpijggmjj) currently being developed [(source code)](https://github.com/lefnire/habitrpg-chrome)
* Authentication (Facebook / Twitter)
* Groups, so you can compete with your friends
* Integration with productivity tools such as Pivotal Tracker, Pomodoro, RescueTime, and MyFitnessPal
* [See the full list](https://workflowy.com/shared/cd06313a-7c93-ae5f-ae55-e64cae0556e4/)
