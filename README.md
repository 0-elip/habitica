##FAQ

###What is habit tracking?

See [Trackers vs Lifehackers](http://blog.beeminder.com/trackhack/) for a description and more habit tracking examples.
  
###This is confusing

If you played RPGs (Role Playing Games) growing up, this app will make sense to you; otherwise, it might be overwhelming at first. Be sure to follow the tutorial when you first load the website. If it's still not your cup of tea, checkout [Trackers vs Lifehackers](http://blog.beeminder.com/trackhack/) for alternatives.

###How do I heal?

After you play for a while you unlock the Item Store from which you can buy health potions. Also, HP resets upon leveling up (of course!).
  
###All my tasks are red, I'm dying too fast

Good! Your red tasks provide the most incentive. The worse you are at a task, the more valuable it becomes in Exp & GP, which will push you to focus on the harder tasks. However, if you *really* need a bail-out, you can "Re-Roll" from the item store for $1, which resets all your tasks to a clean slate. It costs real money to prevent you from abusing it.
