###API
HabitRPG has a simple API for up-scoring and down-scoring third party Habits: ```POST /users/:userId/tasks/:taskId/:direction```. This API is currently used in the [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/habitrpg/pidkmpibnnnhneohdgjclfdjpijggmjj), and you can use it wherever (eg, I'm using it in my [Pomodoro scripts](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s17/sh/9cd765e9-9b5e-44ff-a3e1-b46691c3f593/4ab39c1fca3fe6d54c831dfe6550bf5d)).
