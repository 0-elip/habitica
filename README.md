A habit tracker app which treats your goals like a Role Playing Game. As you accomplish goals, you level up. If you fail your goals, you lose hit points. Lose all your HP and you die.

FAQ
-------
* **What is habit tracking?**

  See [7 Tools to Help Keep Track of Habits and Goals](http://www.lifehack.org/articles/technology/7-tools-to-help-keep-track-of-habits-and-goals.html) for a description and more habit tracking examples.
  
* **This is confusing**

  If you played RPGs (Role Playing Games) growing up, this app will make perfect sense to you; otherwise, it might be overwhelming at first. Be sure to follow the tutorial when you first load the website. If it's still not your cup of tea, checkout the above link, as well as [MindBloom](https://www.mindbloom.com/).

* **How do I heal?**

  After you play for a while you unlock the Item Store, from which you can buy health potions. Also, HP resets upon leveling up.
  
* **My tasks are too red, they're killing me too fast**
  
  This is good. The worse you are at a task, the more valuable it becomes - meaning you gain more experience for completing those red tasks. This will incentivise you to try harder the more you're struggling, as well as to avoid failing (since the more valuable tasks drain more HP). If you're *really* struggling, you can buy "Re-Roll" from the item store, which resets all your tasks to 0.
