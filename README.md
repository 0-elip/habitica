============

A habit tracker app which treats your goals like a Role Playing Game.  As you accomplish goals, you level up and earn gold to spend on rewards. When you fail at your goals, you lose hit points. Lose all your HP and you die (aka, have to start over with GP & Lvl).

FAQ
-------
* **How do I heal?**

  You have to level up, HP resets on ding (you'll understand if you're familiar with RPGs). I'm thinking of adding a buyable Health Potion, but I think this might compromise pushing yourself. Think about it - the closer you are to leveling, the harder you'll try to be accountable. 
  
* **My tasks are too red, they're killing me too fast**
  
  This is good. The worse you are at a task, the more valuable it becomes - meaning you gain more experience for completing those red tasks. This will incentivise you to try harder the more you're struggling, as well as to avoid failing (since the more valuable tasks drain more HP).
